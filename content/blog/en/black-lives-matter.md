This week Stackshare posted a running list of [developer tools companies](https://github.com/stackshareio/dev-tools-for-blm) supporting #BlackLivesMatter on Github. Companies like [Elastic](https://www.elastic.co/), [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and [React Training](https://reacttraining.com/) moved quickly to match donations to organizations doing important work to fuel the potential for change in the United States.

In solidarity with the black community and with the intent of carrying forward the momentum created by the development community at large, Dojo, in partnership with [SitePen](https://www.sitepen.com), will match donations, up to a total contribution of $10,000, to the following organizations:
