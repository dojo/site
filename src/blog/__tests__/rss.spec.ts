## Being a Better Dojo

Developer ergonomics, efficient source code, consistent and flexible architecture, interoperability and alignment with modern standards, and strong community support are fundamental reasons for choosing a framework. Weâ€™re constantly looking for ways to improve Dojo and provide the community with the best possible modern framework.

## Dojo CLI Tooling

The main focus of version 4 of Dojo is improving application optimization and analyzing, focusing on tooling that can enable these features by default. Separating a Dojo application into bundles (often referred to as code splitting) has been possible since the initial Dojo release. Although this did not require you to change your source code, it did require adding some configuration to specify how your application should be bundled. We wanted to do better by default and in version 4, the [Dojo build tooling will automatically split an application based on its top-level routes](https://github.com/dojo/cli-build-app#code-splitting-by-route)!

The application template used by \`cli-build-app\` provides this functionality out of the box. In addition to this a bundle analyzer is automatically generated when running a build in production mode, providing even more insight into you bundles.
